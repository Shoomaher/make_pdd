Python script for making pdf files for pdd.ua
I couldn't find ukrainian driving rules in a pdf
The only thing I could found was pdd.ua
So I coded a simple tool for making pdf files from the webpages and then uniting them into one file
Unfortunately, unitepdf isn't the best tool for that
Pesonally, I recommend using ilovepdf.com cause it provides table of contents for result file
