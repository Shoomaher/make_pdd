Python script for making pdf files for pdd.ua  
I couldn't find ukrainian driving rules in a pdf  
The only thing I could found was pdd.ua  
So I coded a simple tool for making pdf files from the webpages and then uniting them into one file  
There are 2 versions of tool: make2.py provides optimized output  
Unfortunately, unitepdf isn't the best tool for that  
Pesonally, I recommend using ilovepdf.com instead of my script cause it provides table of contents for result file  
  
Python, wkhtmltopdf and unitepdf must be installed (can be easily googled)
